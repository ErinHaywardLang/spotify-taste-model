# spotify-taste-model

A personal machine learning project to predict how much I'll like a song and rank Spotify's Discover Weekly and Release Radar playlists. 

This is an exploratory project where I combine the Spotify Web API with Python and ML techniques to help me prioritise which songs to listen to each week. 

## Goals
- Build a personal music preference model
- Pull my weekly spotify playlists
- Score and rank songs based on predicted enjoyment
- Make listening to Discover Weekly & Release Radar more efficient 

## Tech Stack 
- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Spotipy (Spotify Web API)
- Pandas & NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- python-dotenv

## Setup
1. Clone the repo
2. Create and activate a virtual environment 
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Add a `.env` file with your Spotify API credentials (WIP)
5. Run notebooks or `run_weekly.py` to pull and score playlists (WIP)
